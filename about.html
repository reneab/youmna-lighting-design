                                provide ambience, simulate textures, trigger emotions and influence behaviour.

                            <p>As Architectural Lighting Designers, we use both light and darkness to enhance the
                                spatial
                                experience
                                in the built environment. Despite common beliefs, we don't see light as a decorative
                                add-on, but
                                as
                                a fundamental tool to reveal the architectural design.
                            </p>

                            <h5>How do we work with light?</h5>
                            <p>We get involved at the first stages of the design process to carefully understand design
                                briefs,
                                client needs and budget constraints. Working closely with architects and designers, we
                                develop
                                narratives in which light defines the core character of the architectural design and
                                create
                                unique
                                atmospheres.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our independent take on existing technologies and luminaires manufacturers allows us to
                                maintain
                                an
                                unbiased approach. Through the use of lighting software, samples testing and mock-ups,
                                we
                                carefully
                                select luminaires by evaluating cost, quality and performance to successfully deliver
                                our
                                lighting
