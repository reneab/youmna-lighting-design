						<h5>What is light?</h5>
						<p>Light is a powerful medium.
						</p>
						<p>It is intangible, invisible, ethereal and ever-changing, yet it can transform and reveal spaces, provide
							ambience, simulate textures, trigger emotions and influence behaviour.
						</p>
						<p>As Architectural Lighting Designers, we use both light and darkness to enhance the spatial experience and visual
							environment. Despite common beliefs, we don't see light as a decorative add-on, but as a fundamental tool to
							reveal the architectural design.
						</p>
						<h5>How do we work with light?</h5>
						<p>We get involved at the first stages of the design process to carefully understand design briefs, client needs,
							budget constraints and programmes. Working closely with architects and designers, we develop narratives that
							define the core character of the architectural design and create unique atmospheres.
						</p>
						<p>We remain independent yet collaborate with various lighting manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to provide an
							unbiased approach. Through the use of lighting software, samples and mock-ups, we carefully select luminaires by
							evaluating cost, quality and performance to successfully deliver our lighting schemes.
						</p>
						<h5>How do we collaborate?</h5>
						<p>We follow the typical RIBA Plan of Work which allows close collaboration with design teams whilst simultaneously
							providing creative freedom.</p>
